## Project Objective:

We need to provide information to help with making an informed decision by answering the following questions:

1. Is there a significant difference in the median value of houses bounded by the Charles river or not?
2. Is there a difference in median values of houses of each proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940?
3. Can we conclude that there is no relationship between Nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town?
4. What is the impact of an additional weighted distance to the five Boston employment centres on the median value of owner-occupied homes?
